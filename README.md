## Overview
### Description
UCSD Dining Hall Review App provides a platform for students to express their opinion on on-campus dinning hall. Students can choose the dining hall that they want to get food at based on the reviews. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Review and Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile, however, we might do a web version of the app so that students can access the app through their computer
- **Story:** Users can view reviews on different dining hall on campus, and they would have the choice to write their own review 
- **Market:** UCSD students 
- **Habit:** This app can be used often with students who like to dine in at school dining hall  
- **Scope:** This app can potentially be an app for all colleges. We can potentially change the dining hall names and have other college students to use the app.
